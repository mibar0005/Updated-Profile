					<h1>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
                    <p>My name is Miguel Ibarra, I am Software Developer Engineer based in Riverside California</p>
                    <p>I work with the Full Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
                    <p>One of my special things is my Analytical Mindset. I have a passion for problem-solving and good systems-level thinking skills. 
                        A second skill that makes me stand out is my technical mindset. I understand the computer's logic and I am able to communicate technical
                        ideas to non-technical people as well as customers. My curiosity and inquisitiveness is also something that makes me stand out. I enjoy 
                        finding the solution to a problem and deep-diving into why things are function the way they do
                    </p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item item-double">
            <p>One of the concepts that makes me passionate about Web Development is the continuous learning journey. It is a life long journey in which you have to learn new languages and keep now with new features. 
              I am also passionate about the competitiveness in the field that makes me want to push and learn more.</p>
            <p>My desire to work with a team is one of my most solid foundations. Whether it is working with other developers, marketing team, support, or sales teams my desire to learn about other departments and learn more 
                about the company for which I am working for fulfills my desire for learning. Working with a team can help push projects out faster, it makes brainstorming sessions better, and when programming two brains are always
            better than one. </p>
            <p>The services that I provide range from creating awesome websites for your business, to creating databases. I also specialize in creating web-tools that can help you manage your business and can help you keep track
                of employees, inventory, and logistics.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of coding, you might find me at a National Park exploring the outdoors, at a music and arts festival, or playing racquetball.</p>
